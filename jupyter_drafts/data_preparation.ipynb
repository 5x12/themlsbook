    "- Compatibility: Different algorithms and models may require input data to be in a specific format. For example, some algorithms may only accept numerical data, while others may only accept categorical data. Encoding variables allows us to convert data into the required format so that it can be used as input to these algorithms.\n",
    "- Improved performance: Encoding variables can sometimes improve the performance of an algorithm. For example, encoding categorical variables as numerical data can allow them to be used in algorithms that only accept numerical data, which can lead to better results.\n",

For example, encoding a categorical variable as a set of binary variables can make it easier to understand the relationship between the variable and the target variable in a regression model.\n",

    "Feature scaling is a preprocessing step that is commonly used in machine learning and data science to standardize or normalize the range of independent variables or features of a dataset. There are a few reasons why feature scaling is important:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithms can converge faster: Many machine learning algorithms use some form of distance to measure the similarity between data points. If the features in a dataset have different scales, then the distance between data points will be dominated by the features with the larger scales, which can cause the algorithm to converge slowly or poorly. Feature scaling helps to balance the scales of the features, which can improve the convergence rate of the algorithm.\n",
    "- Algorithms can perform better: Some machine learning algorithms are sensitive to the scale of the input features and can perform poorly if the features are not scaled. For example, algorithms that use gradient descent (such as linear regression) can converge faster and perform better if the features are scaled.\n",
    "- Easier to interpret the results: Feature scaling can also make it easier to interpret the results of an analysis. When features are on different scales, it can be difficult to compare the importance of different features. Scaling the features allows us to compare the features on a level playing field, which can make it easier to understand the results of an analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, feature scaling is an important preprocessing step that can improve the performance and interpretability of machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will learn two feature scaling techniques:\n",
    "- feature standardization, using `preprocessing.StandardScaler()` \n",
    "- feature normalization, using `preprocessing.MinMaxScaler()`."

    "Feature binning is the process that converts a numerical (either continuous and discrete) feature into a categorical feature represented by a set of ranges, or bins. For example, instead of representing age as a single real-valued feature, we chop ranges of age into 3 discrete bins: young ∈ [ages 25−34], middle ∈ [ages 35−44], old ∈[ages 45−54]. Let's see how it works in practice."
