    "- The cost function\n",
    "- The solvers\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Sigmoid\n",
    "\n",
    "We have previously covered the sigmoid function. Essentially, coding this function is a straightforward task that requires just a single line of code. To deepen your understanding of the underlying logic, you can use a slider to manipulate the value of 'z'—the output from linear regression. This interactive approach will help you visualize how changes in 'z' affect the sigmoid output.\n",

    "### 3.2 Intercept\n",
    "\n",
    "The intercept helps handle the bias that's naturally present in real data. Without the intercept, we'd assume that with no influence from our features, the chances of seeing a '0' or a '1' are equally split at 50-50. But in many cases, that's not quite right. In our problem, the ratio of women without any disease is much higher, so the model should take this into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "From mathematical POV, we have a basic equation of Logistic Regression:\n",

    "\n",
    "$w_0$ - intercept term.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add the possibility to have bias, i.e. intercept, we add an extra feature that's always set to a constant value of 1 and added into our matrix. By doing this, the model has a place to store the value of intercept by multiplying it on 1.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to better understand how it really affects the internal process, we can build a simple vizual, where we can set different intercept values and get the skewed sigmoid. As you could guess, the higher the intercept value, the more sigmoid skewed to the right (because that means that we need lower value of linear regression output 'z' as intercept will compesate it)\n",

    "### 3.3 Cost function\n",
    "\n",
    "In the book, we've already explored the role of cost functions and the rationale for applying penalties to them. Implementing this in Python isn't challenging; it primarily involves configuring various parameters and outputting an equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the cost function consistently uses cross-entropy loss. All that's required is to define a set of predefined parameters to incorporate into the function.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "m = len(y) # Number of training examples\n",
    "h = self.sigmoid(np.dot(X, w)) # Predicted probabilities for the positive class using the sigmoid function\n",
    "epsilon = 1e-5 # Small constant to prevent log(0) situations, ensuring numerical stability\n",
    "\n",
    "cost = -1/m * (np.dot(y, np.log(h + epsilon)) + np.dot((1 - y), np.log(1 - h + epsilon))) # Compute the cross-entropy loss\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, we need to add some conditional operators which will define the regularization we use (if we use any). For each of this regularization we simply add its value to the defined cost function and get the final cost for the model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, the hardest thing to possibly understand are solvers. They were mainly not covered in the book, but this is mostly the most crucial part of the regression, because it does all the 'mathematical' part of predicting the unseen target. There are 7 solvers which will be covered here one-by-one\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4.1 Gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "The first solver is not presented in the sklearn library, however, it is a good starting point in understanding how they work in terms of code. The idea behind gradient is already explained in `add link to book`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we recap some thing from there, the gradient descent is used as one of the bacis optimization algorithms to minimize the cost function. By iteratively updating parameters by moving in the opposite direction of the gradient of the cost function. This movement is proportional to the learning rate, which controls the step size of each update. We stop this movement when the changes are becoming too small.\n",
    "\n",

    "In order to do it by ourself, firstly we need to define the function to calculate the gradient. To do this, we need to calculate the predicted probabilities for each class, which will tell us about how good we are at precising the true label. After this, we aggregate the errors weighted by features to get the gradient of the loss. Finally, we average it by dividing it on the number of observations to get the to scale it appropriately. \n",

    "Now when we have an ability to calculate gradient at each step, we can loop it into updating weight and get the final function for gradient descent method. To do so, we take our initial weights firstly, but on every iteration we update it to the opposite direction of gradient by substracting it. If you pay close attention, you can see, that the gradient is being multiplied by learning rate. It is a parameter which controls the step of each update. It helps to control the convergence speed and not allow the algorithm to overshoot the minimum and fail to converge, which is especially crucial on the first steps, when we do not have much information about minimum point and start in random point.\n",
